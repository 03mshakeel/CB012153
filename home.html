        <h1>INTROUCTION</h1>
        <P>Sea turtle hatcheries exist as an ex situ conservation tool in many countries , including the southeastern coast of Sri Lanka. However, doubts have been raised about the effective contribution of hatcheries to the conservation of sea turtles . Tisdell and Wilson  modeled the role of tourism-based sea turtle hatcheries by combining economical and ecological parameters, and demonstrated that hatcheries can make a positive contribution to sea turtle conservation, but their effectiveness depends on their management.

            <h1>TURTLES</h1>
            <p>Of the seven sea turtles species in the world, five <b> (the green, Chelonia mydas; leatherback, Dermochelys coriacea; loggerhead, Caretta caretta; hawksbill, Eretmochelys imbricata; and, olive ridley, Lepidochelys olivacea) </b>nest in Sri Lanka (Deraniyagala, 1953). Nesting occurs throughout the year, but March to May is considered as the nesting season with a peak in April (Ekanayake et al., 2002; 2010). The south and southeast coastlines, encompassing suitable beaches and vast areas of seagrass beds and coral reefs, provide important nesting and foraging grounds (Deraniyagala, 1939; Amarasooriya, 2000). This area has a high human population and tourism is also largely concentrated along these coasts. A study conducted in 2007 indicated that many villagers from the nesting areas had eaten turtle eggs, but most of the consumption occurred during the 1990’s or earlier (Rajakaruna et al., 2009)

            <h1>HISTORY OF TURTLES</h1>
            <p>The first Sri Lankan sea turtle hatchery was established in 1956 at Yala National Park by the Wildlife and Nature Protection Society of Sri Lanka, a non-governmental organization for nature conservation. A second hatchery was established at Palatupana in 1969. Both hatcheries were opened with conservation, restoration and management of the sea turtles and their habitats in Sri Lanka as the main objectives. The number of hatcheries increased rapidly in the 1970’s, with as many as 23 additional hatcheries opening (Fernando, 1977). The number of hatcheries has since varied: 16 hatcheries were recorded in 1994 (Richardson, 1995) and 25 hatcheries were listed in the proposed action plan for conservation restoration and management of turtles and their habitats in Sri Lanka in 1996 (de Silva, 1996). However, a survey conducted in 1996 recorded only seven hatcheries (Amarasooriya & Dayaratne, 1997). Wickremasinghe (1982) estimated that during 1981 and 1982 three hatcheries used 48,934 turtle eggs; IUCN (2005) estimated that nine hatcheries used ~300,000 turtle eggs in 2000.

            During the 1990’s, only two hatcheries in operation defined conservation as their main objective, and the remainder operated primarily for commercial gain (IUCN, 2005). The long-term success of these programs cannot be evaluated, as hatcheries rarely kept records of hatching success or tracked hatchlings once they left the beach (Hewavisenthi, 1993; Hewavisenthi & Kotagama, 1990). While the contribution of turtle hatcheries to the conservation of sea turtles was highly debated, the Department of Wildlife Conservation (DWC) in Sri Lanka considered that management techniques in operation at the majority of hatcheries were not conducive to the conservation of sea turtles (IUCN, 2005). We conducted a survey to assess the activities of current hatcheries in Sri Lanka, and the potential contribution to sea turtle conservation.

            <h1>TYPES OF TURTLES</h1>
            <p>Sri Lanka has five species of egg laying sea turtles that lay eggs at different points along Sri Lanka's stunning coastline. These are: <br><br>

                Green Turtle (the most common) <br>
                
                Olive Ridley Turtle <br>
                
                Hawksbill Turtle <br>
                
                Leatherback Turtle <br>
                
                Loggerhead Turtle <br><br>
                
                Their existence is reported to stretch back to the time of dinosaurs around 110 million years ago, making them on the oldest creatures on the planet. They can live up to the ripe old age of around 80 years and contrary to popular myth sea turtles cannot tuck their heads into their shells. It's said that they can see better under water than on land. They are categorized as a reptiles due to being cold blooded, having scaly skin and a three chambered heart.
                
                Almost all sea turtle species are listed as Endangered Species, so it is important to us that you gather an understanding from the hatchery about the sea turtles and the hatchery will explain to you the story behind the sea turtle in Sri Lanka and the efforts practiced to protect them. There are different hatcheries along the coast, we will send you to one of the most reputable ones. They exist to protect the species and to conserve them, essentially by protecting them from anything that fancies eating them such as birds, fish, people and anything else that has an appetite. The hatchery rescues eggs from poachers (who often see the eggs as a food source) they also rescue turtles from nets so some have injuries that require rehabilitation.  Some sea turtle hatcheries told us that they have released over 500,000 sea turtles back into the Indian Ocean.
