                <h3>Nesting Habitat Destruction</h3>
                <p>Collecting eggs from the sea turtles’ natural nest for relocation, decreases hatching success rates from 90% in natural nests to 50 – 70% in hatcheries.According to the Sea Turtle Conservancy, cooler sand has a tendency to produce more males, with warmer sand producing females. The potentially higher temperatures in our hatcheries, due to overcrowding, may produce an unnaturally high ratio of females to males, which overall affects with the survival of the species.Keeping hatchlings in small tanks, swimming in circles for days or weeks, consumes their stored energy and makes them weak. After they’re eventually released, the energy they would have to swim out to the deep ocean and survive predators, is low.</p>

                <h3>Artificial Lighting and Climate Change</h3>
                <p>Nesting sea turtles prefer dark, quiet beaches to lay their eggs. Lights from buildings along the coast distract and confuse adult female turtles and the hatchlings. Additionally, Sri Lanka is more dependent on nonrenewable energy. As we all experience, night lights could be better managed and usefully burn fossil fuels.  Also, when the young turtles emerge from the nest at night, they are drawn toward the lights instead of the water. A single light can cause hundreds of misdirected hatchlings to be killed or dehydrated in the morning sun.  Furthermore, predators like birds, crabs, and other mammals increase their chance of being killed.</p>

                <h3>Unintentional harm</h3>
                <p>Some local people hunt turtles for their shells. The Hawksbill turtle, which is critically endangered, was the main source of tortoiseshell material until laws eliminated the trade. But people still poach these turtles and sell the shells.However, the unintentional harm that people inflict on sea turtles might be even more damaging. Countless animals are entangled and perish in fishing nets each year. Boats also strike many as they swim near the surface. Pollution, both physical and chemical, also harms turtles. A major factor in turtle deaths is the explosion of plastic in the oceans. Adults often eat jellyfish, and they often mistake plastic bags for prey. Man-made chemicals also affect the turtles, causing fertility issues and even tumours..</p>

        <h1>SOLUTION</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="solve1">
        <h3>Nesting Habitat Destruction</h3>
        <p>
        Implement and enforce strict coastal development regulations to prevent encroachment on nesting 
        <br>
        Promote beach restoration and stabilization efforts to combat erosion and maintain suitable nesting habitats.
        <br>
        public awareness about the importance of protecting nesting beaches and encourage responsible tourism practices.<br>

        <h3>Artificial Lighting and Climate Change</h3>
        <h4>Artificial Lighting </h4>
        <p>
        <b>Implement and enforce lighting regulations:</b>  Establish regulations that restrict or regulate artificial lighting near nesting beaches and important turtle habitats. This can include guidelines for shielding lights, reducing light intensity, and enforcing light curfews during the nesting season.
        <br>
        <b>Raise public awareness:</b> Educate coastal residents, businesses, and tourists about the negative impacts of artificial lighting on turtles. Promote responsible practices, such as turning off unnecessary lights or using curtains/blinds to block light from reaching the beach.
        <br>
        <h4>Climate Change</h4>
        <b>Protect and restore critical habitats:</b> Preserve and restore key nesting beaches, dunes, and coastal ecosystems that are vital for turtle survival. These habitats act as buffers against climate change impacts, such as rising sea levels and increased erosion.
        <br>
        <b>Monitor and research:</b> Continuously monitor and study the impacts of climate change on turtle populations to better understand their vulnerabilities and inform conservation efforts. This includes tracking temperature trends, sea-level rise, and nesting success rates.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="solve1">
        <h3>Unintentional harm</h3>
        <p>
          <b>Bycatch reduction techniques:</b> Encourage the adoption of bycatch reduction techniques by fishermen, such as using circle hooks instead of J-hooks, which can reduce turtle hooking. Additionally, promoting the use of specialized fishing gear, such as barium sulfate lines, can increase the visibility of fishing gear to turtles and reduce entanglement. <br>

          <b>Education and training:</b> Conduct training programs and workshops for fishermen, educating them about the importance of turtle conservation and providing them with knowledge and skills to minimize unintentional harm. This can include teaching proper handling and release techniques for accidentally captured turtles. <br>
            
          <b>Technology and innovation:</b> Support research and development of innovative technologies and fishing gear modifications that minimize unintended harm to turtles. This can involve the use of acoustic deterrent devices or LED lights on fishing gear to deter turtles from approaching. <br>
            
        <b>Collaboration and stakeholder engagement:</b> Foster collaboration between fishermen, conservation organizations, and government agencies to develop and implement strategies for reducing unintentional harm. Engage stakeholders in the decision-making process to ensure that fishing practices and regulations are effective and practical. <br>
